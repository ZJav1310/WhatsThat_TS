# REDUX IS AMAZING..
- It is overkill for this project, ABORT ABORT

I need to be able to access/do:

- Chat list
  - Log when it was fetched?
  - check incoming chat summary for updates?
    - check if the last message is different to the one stored, if it is fetch new messages?
    - I dont think the API has option to return anything after given time or something
    - 
- Messages?
- Friends list
- User info

If i use the useContext etc, how do i make it persistent?

It was the same but look what i had to do to make it work with ts
